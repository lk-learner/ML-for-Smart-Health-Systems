Project-4 Instructions:

Read about human cough types - dry and wet, volunatry/ involuntary, etc. (reference: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9175986). Why cough is an important biomarker for respiratory disease? Do cough frequency vary with disease severity?

Select a sound classification dataset containing cough/ lungs/ heart sound e.g. ESC-50 dataset https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50

Make a new dataset with human cough sounds in one class and 4 other types of sounds e.g. sneezing, door knocking, raining, dog barking etc. in another class

Listen to the sounds and visualize some instances/ spectogram using the software Audacity https://www.audacityteam.org/

Label the target class audio records as cough and the other class audio records as not cough (reference: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336011335_Efficient_Online_Cough_Detection_with_a_Minimal_Feature_Set_Using_Smartphones_for_Automated_Assessment_of_Pulmonary_Patients

Split your dataset into train and test set

Develop a cough classification model using the training set and evaluate the model performance on test set

Retrain another model using the same dataset with Teachable Machine Platform

Export the model and evaluate it in python on the test data

Compare your model performance with that of teachable machine

Push your code to project-4 branch of the course Github and make a pull request.
