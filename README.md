This repo have all the notebooks that I have worked on during ML for smart health course.

Project-1 Instructions

Select a sleep apnea database (e.g. apnea-ecg database from Physionet) and read the dataset descriptions to identify the healthy and apnea subjects.

Download all the records, and process the records to extract HRV features using a software (e.g. HRVanalysis) or in python.

Visualize/compare the features using descriptive statistics between healthy and apneic subjects.

Use inferential statistics (e.g. t-test, Mann-Whitney U test) to find if there is any significant difference between the groups.
